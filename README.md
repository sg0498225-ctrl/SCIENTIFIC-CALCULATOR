Scientific Calculator

Overview of the Project

This project is a Scientific Calculator designed to perform both basic and advanced mathematical operations. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily calculate arithmetic expressions, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, power operations, and more. The goal of this project is to offer a reliable and efficient calculator tool for students, developers, and general users.

Features

Basic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

Scientific functions: Trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, factorial, power, square root

Clear and delete functions

Error handling for invalid inputs

User-friendly interface (UI if applicable)

Real-time calculation display


Technologies / Tools Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Tkinter (for GUI) / Math module

IDE (optional): VS Code / PyCharm / IDLE


Steps to Install & Run the Project

1. Install Python 3.x on your system.


2. Download or clone the project repository.


3. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.


4. Install required libraries (usually no extra installation needed except Python).


5. Run the script using:

python scientific_calculator.py


6. The calculator window will open and is ready to use.



Instructions for Testing

Enter different expressions to test basic and scientific operations.

Try trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) with various values.

Test error handling by entering invalid expressions like “1/0”.

Use the clear/reset button to verify functionality.
